ideas

add the player that eliminate the other to the kill feed. my innital idea of the player who "eliminated them" is just the player that is responsible for most lines sent to them
another idea is that its the most lines sent to them in a certain amount of time before they are eliminated

Passives- a player can chose 2 or and each combination of 2 have a different ult
perhaps they have to be unlocked by playing online
perhaps instead of choseing they are random.
perhaps they should come with downsides

Ideas for spesific passives/ults

something to do with gambling - ult/passive combo
whenever you clear x line's or complete a spesific task like get get a quad,triple,double or something else it spins a roulete wheel 
the roulete wheel has many differnt abilities and perhapsit should just be an ult or madey the gambling passive has no ult and there is a bar that rises the more times you spin the roulete wheel or slot machine
the more the bar rises the more likley that you get a jackpot but its still suposed to be possible to get a jackpot with the bar empty it should  just get more likley as it fills.

ideas for jackpot effect
your combo never drops for x amount of time or you get combo saves that when you miss a block or your combo would uualy drop it saves it for that spesific block
need to come up with idea for downside but im thinking when you gamble there will be sent 1 or 2 lines or something menial that is annoying but still isnt a commplete loose condition
the lines that are cleared go into the bar where lines that are sent to you go so that you can clear them before they ad up. 
make sure the lines add to the recived counter but dont count as sent by any player

extra held block - passive
this could be bined to crtl or caps lock or you could hit the c button to swap but i prefer the idea of a seperate button
the downside wuld be your combo would increase slower so instead of 0-0-1-1-2-2-3-3-4-4 or however it currently works it would stay on a number for 3 times you combo instead of 2
another idea for a ownside that dosent nessicarily apply to this passive is just a multiplyer like .5 or .75 on all the lines you send
another idea is to ad a multiplyer on incoming garbage but i dont want to add to many downsieds that change garbage to avoi them to bet reundant and boring
